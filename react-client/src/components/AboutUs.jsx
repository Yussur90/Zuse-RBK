	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<p >Some years back, nobody paid much attention to the accumulation of waste 
	in homes and landfills. It became so vast that the authorities started getting
	concerned the phenomenon could create a disaster. A solution had to be found, 
	but one that is kind to humans and the environment. Thatâ€™s how recycling was born.
	Recycling is the process of converting waste into new, useful products. 
	Waste materials that can be recycled include plastic bottles, paper, cardboard,
	food and drink cans, trays, tabs, food and beverages cartons, and aluminum foils. 
	Although recycling has been going on for the past few years, recycling efforts need 
	to be increased considering the amount of waste disposed of every day.

	Several reasons exist as to why we should promote recycling. Recycling helps us to 
	convert our old products into new useful products. In other words, it is good for 
	the environment. Since we are saving resources and are sending less trash to the landfills, 
	it helps in reducing air and water pollution. Listed below are few reasons why we should all 
	recycle old products</p>
